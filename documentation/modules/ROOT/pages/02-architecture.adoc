== An in-depth look at the solution's architecture

This solution pattern uses the following components:

* GitHub Repository: It contains the application code and we will use GitHub Actions to create a workflow that will deploy the application to Managed Openshift clusters.
* Terraform: Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that enables you to safely and predictably provision and manage infrastructure in any cloud. We will use Terraform to create ROSA clusters in AWS.
* AWS accounts: Amazon Web Services offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services. Here, we will be using two AWS accounts in which we have the required admin privileges via AWS IAM/STS workflows.
